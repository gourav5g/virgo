**Virgo** is a lightweight, high-speed fuzzing tool designed for Linux, built in Python. It leverages asynchronous HTTP requests to quickly test web endpoints for vulnerabilities or hidden resources. Virgo is ideal for security researchers, penetration testers, and developers who need a fast and customizable fuzzing solution.

 Features
- **Asynchronous Requests**: Uses `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for blazing-fast fuzzing.
- **Premium Templates**: Includes built-in high-quality templates for common fuzzing scenarios.
- **Custom Wordlists**: Supports user-provided wordlists or generates random inputs.
- **Configurable**: Adjust delay, max requests, and templates via CLI.
- **Simple Setup**: Easy to install and use on any Linux system.
Let’s create a fast fuzzing tool for Linux called **Virgo**, written in Python. Virgo will be a simple, lightweight, and customizable fuzzing tool designed to test web endpoints by sending random or templated inputs at high speed. It will leverage Python’s `asyncio` for asynchronous requests to maximize performance, making it one of the fastest options for basic fuzzing tasks. I'll provide a full tutorial on how to install, set it up, push it to GitHub, include premium templates, and write a README file description.

### Step 1: Design and Code the Virgo Tool

**Features of Virgo:**
- Asynchronous HTTP requests for speed.
- Support for custom wordlists and premium templates.
- Multithreading and configurable delays.
- Simple CLI interface for ease of use.

Here’s the full code for `virgo.py`:

**Step 1 : Do Sudo Apt Update**

### Step 2: Tutorial - Install and Setup Virgo on Linux

#### Prerequisites
- Linux system (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali, or any distro).
- Python 3.6+ installed.
- Git installed (`sudo apt install git` on Debian-based systems).

#### Installation Steps
1. **Install Required Python Packages**
   Open a terminal and install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   pip3 install aiohttp
   ```

2. **Create a Project Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir virgo-fuzzer
   cd virgo-fuzzer
   ```

3. **Save the Code**
   Copy the `virgo.py` code above into a file named `virgo.py`:
   ```bash
   nano virgo.py
   ```
   Paste the code, save (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`), and make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x virgo.py
   ```

4. **Test Virgo Locally**
   Run Virgo with a sample URL:
   ```bash
   ./virgo.py http://example.com/
   ```
   This will fuzz `http://example.com/` with random words and premium templates. You can also use a custom wordlist:
   ```bash
   ./virgo.py -w /path/to/wordlist.txt http://example.com/

### Step 4: Add Premium Templates

The `PREMIUM_TEMPLATES` list in the code already includes some high-quality templates. To extend it further, you can modify the list in `virgo.py` or pass custom templates via the CLI. For example:
```bash
./virgo.py -t "{FUZZ}.php" "{FUZZ}/admin" "api/{FUZZ}" http://example.com/
```
You can also create a `templates.txt` file with additional premium templates and share it in the GitHub repo:
```
backup/{FUZZ}
{FUZZ}.bak
config/{FUZZ}.json
```
Add this file to GitHub:
```bash
git add templates.txt
git commit -m "Added premium templates file"
git push
